# conflict-resolution

##This is a test for conflict in git, what we do is as we're adding stuff here, we might add something 
#to github directly and commit changes. This means the code we have here will no longer be the same as the one we cloned!

#SOLUTION:
We first mush commit our changes, do a pull request and then do a push request
